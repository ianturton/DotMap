about=A dot-density map is a type of thematic map that uses dots or other symbols on the map to show the values of one or more numeric data fields. Each dot on a dot-density map represents some amount of data. Qgis has not a simbology for this type of data. For this reason, this plugin can create a dot density layer from a polygon layer with a integer field with the data that user would like to convert to dots.
